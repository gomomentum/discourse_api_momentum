      "bio_raw": "The **New Owners Council** oversees the process of new owners entering Momentum, from first contact via the website or Meetup through their initial Launchpad team experience. \n\n- Our forward-facing brand along with gomentum.org, Meetup and Facebook\n\n- Welcoming new men when they show up at general meetings or team visits\n\n- Forming and leading Launchpad teams\n\n- Placing men on teams when Launchpad does not work for them (logistics, etc.)\n\n- Making sure formed teams remain stable\n\n- Exit interviews of men who choose to exit Momentum.\n\n**About Launchpad**\n\nMomentum’s Launchpad team experience is very similar to other Momentum teams, but centered around new men. In order to quickly demonstrate Momentum’s value proposition to new men, the meetings are designed to be more experiential and less verbal instruction. \n\nMomentum teams create a safe space for men to be vulnerable and visible to their teammates. Creating a safe space builds the trust and confidence men need to be open about what’s really going on in their lives. To create the full experience, it is important that new men learn how to feel safe enough to offer honest feedback to the other men. \n\nLaunchpad is experiential: it demonstrates two-way, peer-to-peer vulnerability, man to man. New men learn how their contributions to other men are as important as what they bring away for themselves. \n\nLaunchpad offers a unique bonding experience for new men because they often share similar, recent major life events, e.g. a divorce, which tends to make the men more equally motivated as they launch into men’s work. \n\nLaunchpad is designed to teach Momentum concepts as they come up in context along the way to new men forming a compelling value proposition for being part of Momentum. Once that basic value proposition is in place, Launchpad men are ready for more formalized curriculums like Expedition.\n\n**About Expedition**\n\nWhile Launchpad is designed to demonstrate the basic team experience for a new man, Expedition is designed to offer the next instructive step, once a new man is motivated to:\n\n1. Experience and integrate the fundamentals of Momentum, \n2. Connect with more new men and Momentum veterans, and \n3. Develop a deeper, authentic connection to the larger Momentum community.\n\nExpedition is a systematic, streamlined training course that uses pre-recorded videos, podcasts, online readings and reflections, interactive video conferences, online discussions, and experiential face-to-face trainings. Upon completing Expedition, men gain a deeper sense of self, their relationship with their masculinity, with other men, and their reasons for being in Momentum.",

In order to quickly demonstrate Momentum’s value proposition to new men, the meetings are designed to be more experiential and less verbal instruction.</p>\n<p>Momentum teams create a safe space for men to be vulnerable and visible to their teammates. Creating a safe space builds the trust and confidence men need to be open about what’s really going on in their lives. To create the full experience, it is important that new men learn how to feel safe enough to offer honest feedback to the other men.</p>\n<p>Launchpad is experiential: it demonstrates two-way, peer-to-peer vulnerability, man to man. New men learn how their contributions to other men are as important as what they bring away for themselves.</p>\n<p>Launchpad offers a unique bonding experience for new men because they often share similar, recent major life events, e.g. a divorce, which tends to make the men more equally motivated as they launch into men’s work.</p>\n<p>Launchpad is designed to teach Momentum concepts as they come up in context along the way to new men forming a compelling value proposition for being part of Momentum. Once that basic value proposition is in place, Launchpad men are ready for more formalized curriculums like Expedition.</p>\n<p><strong>About Expedition</strong></p>\n<p>While Launchpad is designed to demonstrate the basic team experience for a new man, Expedition is designed to offer the next instructive step, once a new man is motivated to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Experience and integrate the fundamentals of Momentum,</li>\n<li>Connect with more new men and Momentum veterans, and</li>\n<li>Develop a deeper, authentic connection to the larger Momentum community.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Expedition is a systematic, streamlined training course that uses pre-recorded videos, podcasts, online readings and reflections, interactive video conferences, online discussions, and experiential face-to-face trainings.
