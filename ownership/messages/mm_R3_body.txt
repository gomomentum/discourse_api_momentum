"We sent you a couple messages about your expired Momentum membership asking you to either:

- [Re-join online here.](http://www.gomomentum.org/join)

   or

- Take [Momentum's exit survey here](https://goo.gl/forms/10AslBf1jpR5X6aP2) to help us learn more about your choice to leave Momentum.

If money is an issue, remember that Momentum provides scholarships where needed. Contact me privately at moe1@rubenzahl.com to make arrangements.

Thank you for spending time with Momentum, and thank you for going the final mile so we may have a proper completion if that is your intention.

Moe Rubenzahl
Momentum Chief"
