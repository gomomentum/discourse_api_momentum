"Thank you for your interest in Momentum, #{@man.user_details['name']}. Get ready for years of growth, camaraderie, and fun ahead!

To get the most out of Momentum, you will want to become what we call a Momentum Owner. To do that, simply go [here to become an Owner of Momentum and get full access to all content on the Discourse Community Forum.](#{@schedule.discourse.options[:instance]}/page/ownership/3/)

The nominal $80 membership covers the organization’s basic expenses, gives you full access to all content on Discourse, and easily pays for itself in free breakfasts thru the year. Note: Momentum’s policy is to provide scholarships where there is financial need so that cost never becomes a deterrent to becoming an Owner.*

Welcome!
