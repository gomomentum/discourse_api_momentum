"In just 4 minutes you can help us help you, #{@man.user_details['name'].split[0]}! To do that we just need to better understand your Discourse experience.

All you need to do is take the [Momentum Discourse User Quiz here](#{@options[:poll_url]}). The questions are all yes / no, and you can even stop early if you sense the rest are a 'no'.

  Once you take the quiz you will earn a [Discourse User Badge showing your Discourse User achievement level here](https://discourse.gomomentum.org/u/#{@man.user_details['username']}/badges), and you can [see all possible Momentum Badges that you can earn here](https://discourse.gomomentum.org/badges).

Help us help you while ending your weekend on a highnote! :-)
